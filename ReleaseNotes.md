# Release Notes&mdash;NJOY21
Given here are some release notes for NJOY21. Each release is made through a formal [Pull Request](https://github.com/njoy/NJOY21/pulls) made on GitHub. There are links in this document that point to each of those Pull Requests, where you can see in great details the changes that were made. Often the Pull Requests are made in response to an [issue](https://github.com/njoy/NJOY21/issues). In such cases, links to those issues are also given.

### Regression Tests
There are a number of [regression tests](https://www.njoy21.io/NJOY2016/testDescription.html) with NJOY21. These are the same as used in NJOY2016. Some of them are no longer valid with NJOY21. With NJOY21, features that are not included in ENDF/B-VII.0 or later, are not going to be supported in NJOY21. There are some regression tests that are no going to be supported in NJOY21. They are:

## [NJOY21 1.2.2](https://github.com/njoy/NJOY21/pull/142)
- Updating Legacy NJOY to NJOY2016.61. See [release 2016.61](https://github.com/njoy/NJOY2016/releases/tag/2016.61) for more information
- Adding additional regression tests.

This release is in preparation for the upcoming 1.3.0 release.

## [NJOY21 1.2.1](https://github.com/njoy/NJOY21/pull/126)
This update removes the `--signature` command-line option as that was a feature of the previous build system. This also updates the GitHub Actions such that they now test all of the NJOY21 stuff, but not the integration tests.

## [NJOY21 1.2.0](https://github.com/njoy/NJOY21/pull/122)
This update makes significant changes to the build system. Instead of using a [homegrown](https://github.com/njoy/metaconfigure) method for handling dependencies, we now use the [`FetchContent`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.16/module/FetchContent.html) capabilities in CMake. We now require CMake 3.16 to configure and build NJOY21. 

As part of this update, we have changed the install instructions, which can now be found at [docs.njoy21.io](https://docs.njoy21.io/install.html).

## [NJOY21 1.1.1](https://github.com/njoy/NJOY21/pull/107)
This update fixes an issue where GCC would complain about a "maybe" uninitialized variable in [lipservice](https://github.com/njoy/lipservice). This only happens when compiled in release mode with GCC. Using the clang/LLVM compiler does not invoke this warning/error.

This update address issue #106.

## [NJOY21 1.1.0](https://github.com/njoy/NJOY21/pull/104)
This update moves the C++ standard to C++17; thus, a c++17-compliant compiler is needed to build NJOY21. Fortunately, C++17-compliant compilers have been available for several years.

## [NJOY21 1.0.7](https://github.com/njoy/NJOY21/pull/101)
This update fixes a bug in the error checking for ACER. This bug was fixed in lipservice:

- [ACER NGEND=0](https://github.com/njoy/lipservice/pull/14) which resolves [Issue #15](https://github.com/njoy/lipservice/issues/15)

## [NJOY21 1.0.6](https://github.com/njoy/NJOY21/pull/99)
This update adds to NJOY21 the NJOY2016 capability of >3 IZA values in ACER. This was added in NJOY2016 in [Pull Request #41](https://github.com/njoy/NJOY2016/pull/141). A few updates from lipservice are also included:

- [Removal of dimwits units](https://github.com/njoy/lipservice/pull/10)
- [Adding NZA option to ACER](https://github.com/njoy/lipservice/pull/11), and
- [RECONR to JSON](https://github.com/njoy/lipservice/pull/12).

All of these are included in the this version of NJOY21.
## [NJOY21 1.0.5](https://github.com/njoy/NJOY21/pull/95)
This fixes [Issue \#94](https://github.com/njoy/NJOY21/issues/94) which as caused by [Pull Request \#93](https://github.com/njoy/NJOY21/pull/93).

In [Pull Request#5](https://github.com/njoy/njoy_c_bindings/pull/5) from [njoy_c_bindings](https://github.com/njoy/njoy_c_bindings) the function `njoy_sync_error` was not added. NJOY21 1.0.5 includes [Pull Request#6](https://github.com/njoy/njoy_c_bindings/pull/6) of `njoy_c_bindings` which includes this necessary function.

## [NJOY21 1.0.4](https://github.com/njoy/NJOY21/pull/93)
This version adds the capability to split the output into stderr and stdout. It is facilitated by and depends on [Pull Request#5](https://github.com/njoy/njoy_c_bindings/pull/5) from [njoy_c_bindings](https://github.com/njoy/njoy_c_bindings).

This is a nice little addition because you can see the progress of NJOY21 as it moves through the different NJOY modules. This is also the same behavior as NJOY2016.

## [NJOY21 1.0.3](https://github.com/njoy/NJOY21/pull/92)
Changes in the ENDFtk parser (removing the hopscotch-map dependency) required changes to the build system CMakeLists.txt files. No other code was changed so NJOY21 1.0.3 is equivalent with NJOY21 1.0.2.

## [NJOY21 1.0.2](https://github.com/njoy/NJOY21/pull/87/)
This incorporates the addition of `Ngen8` parameter in MATXSR. This updated occured as a result of [Pull Request \#6](https://github.com/njoy/lipservice/pull/6) from [lipservice](https://github.com/njoy/lipservice).

The manual doesn't state it, but the code allows the parameter `Ngen8` in MATXSR Card1. The updated to lipservice (and thus NJOY21) provides this parameter.

## [NJOY21 1.0.1](https://github.com/njoy/NJOY21/pull/92)
This simply separates the documentation from the code.
