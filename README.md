# NJOY21 --- NJOY for the 21st Century
NJOY21 is the modernized version of NJOY---suitable for computing in the 21st Century. It is based on [NJOY2016](https://njoy.github.io/NJOY21).

## Differences between NJOY21 and NJOY2016
NJOY21 is the modern successor to NJOY2016. It is backwards compatible with NJOY2016---except for a few small changes.

- NJOY21 writes everything to the screen instead of to the `output` file. This can be changed by using the `-o` and providing a filename when running NJOY21.
- The preferred method for using an input file for NJOY21 is to use the `-i` command-line option.

    ```
    njoy21 -i U235.inp -o output
    ```
  While you can redirect input and output using `<` and `>` as before, it is preferred to use `-i` and `-o`.

- NJOY21 verifies all the input parameters before performing any processing. This provides a good mechanism to know if your input is valid and provides lots of information if it is not. (Note: we *cannot* ensure that it is correct; that is your responsibility.) The input verification is very strict; if your input does not conform to what is documented in the [manual](https://github.com/njoy/NJOY2016-manual/blob/master/njoy16.pdf), it will not run in NJOY21.

The command-line option `-h` or `--help` provides a little more information as to how to execute NJOY21.

## NJOY21 Development
NJOY21 is primarily written in modern C++. It consists of many subprojects that are used together to accomplish the entire work that NJOY performs. Initially, NJOY21 just delegates to NJOY2016; this will ensure backwards compatibility. As the different modules/components of NJOY are modernized, the calls to the Fortran modules (i.e., NJOY2016) will be replaced with calls to the modernized code.

Please refer to the [Release Notes](ReleaseNotes.md) to see what has changed from one version to the next.

## Installation
Instructions for building and installing NJOY21---as well as any of the subprojects---are
found on our [website](https://docs.njoy21.io/install.html).

## Version
To see the version number for NJOY21, simply execute (after building):
```bash
njoy21 --version
```
NJOY21 roughly follows semantic versioning, where the version number is: `M.m.u` where `M` is the major version number, `m` is the minor version number, and `u` is the update number. These are updated as follows:

1. The major version number `M` is incremented whenever there is a backwards incompatible change. This doesn't happen very often.
2. The minor version is incremented whenever a new capability is added.
3. The update version is incremented whenever a new changed is added to the master (i.e., main or default) branch. This happens most often.

## Manual
The [NJOY2016 manual](https://github.com/njoy/NJOY2016-manual/blob/master/njoy16.pdf) ([download](https://github.com/njoy/NJOY2016-manual/raw/master/njoy16.pdf)) is the current manual for NJOY21.
